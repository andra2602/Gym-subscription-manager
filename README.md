## 🚀 Work in Progress

This is a university project currently under development.

- **Initial Setup**: During the initial setup phase, I focused on creating the essential **classes** with **attributes**, **constructors**, **getters**, and **setters** to lay a solid foundation for the application. These steps ensure a reliable base for the core functionality and future extensions.

First checkpoint: 14–18 April – Basic structure & core functionality.
